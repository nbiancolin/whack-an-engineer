# imgToV Converter
# your counter registers should be of the following size:
# reg xProgress[4:0];
# reg yProgress[4:0];

you should be sure to set your x and y limits to 30 and 20 respectively
Use this code with your lab 7 part 2 module, just be sure to change the limit from being a 4 x 4 square to the above limits
comment out any lines of code that set colour, and place this after your counters are updated
