how this should all work:

have "reset" be the screen with the sprites

on reset, go to rest state (draws title over screen)

on button press, go to "game state" (draws sprites over screen)

pushing one of 2 buttons changes sprites to "hit" sprites, then after 0.5 s goes back to regular sprites

reset goes back to rest state






==== FSM STATES ====


(RESET) -> Reset all variables
(DRAW REST) -> Draw reset variables
(REST) -> splash screen
(LOADING) -> excuse to clear the screen and reset (purely for optics)
(DRAW_HATS) -> draw full screen of hats
(GAME_STEADY) -> waiting for updates to draw hats
(HIT_HAT) -> hat is ready to be hit
(HIT) -> hat is hit
(GAME_OVER) -> Displays game over  (updates "high score" reg)



== SIMPLIDIED FSM == (for testing)

(RESET) -> reset all variables
(LOADING) -> Clears screen (minus tape measure)
(DRAW_GAME) -> draws full game screen
(G_STEADY) -> waits for one of 3 buttons to go to next state
(G_HIT) -> draws the hat that has been hit
(G_RESET) -> Draws hat back to original
